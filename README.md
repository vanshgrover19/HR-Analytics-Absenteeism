# HR-Analytics-Absenteeism
In this  project, I will be evaluating an HR dataset about absenteeism and health. I will use my skills to provide a data driven approach to determine how to provide a bonus and incentive to healthy employees. I will also develop a database, SQL queries to answer questions and build a dashboard which meets a wireframe specification.
